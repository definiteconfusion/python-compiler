## Welcome to the Compyler!
This project aims to (hopefully) build a framework that allows for python based compiled programming. With that said some changes to the way code is written are going to have to be made. Most Python developers, myself included, have a huge relience on third party libraries, that would mean that the compiler would have to build a dependency tree and go back to compile any and all files that the user's file in dependent on...... that simply isn't plausible. The aim is to include a way to add Compyler specific libraries with pre-compiled binaries ready to be imported by the user's compiled Rust file. I would love some help on this project, if you wanna join the team, I would love to have you, just shoot me an emial at djakerase@proton.me (preferable set the subject to something kinda weird so I see it )

Thanks,
